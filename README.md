Project practicing use of web view and menus. Contains 3 pages accessed by bottom navigation. Home, configuration, and a channel list. 
Channel list can be modified by configuration page to add additional buttons to the end of the button list.
Not all buttons currently work, as some links have degraded and have not been removed at this time.
Additions to channel list do not carry over between sessions.
Needs additional testing on an actual android device.
